# Getting Started

## Installing

You can install Up! React-Controls with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-controls) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install @up-group/react-controls --save`
- YARN: `yarn add @up-group/react-controls`

#### Development Builds
Our continuous integration server runs all tests on every commit to master and
if they pass it will publish a new development build to NPM and tag it with the `@dev` tag.
This means that if you want the bleeding edge of `react-controls` you can simply do:

```bash
yarn add @up-group/react-controls@dev
```

This will install the version currently tagged as `@dev`. Your `package.json` file will be
locked to that specific version.

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "reaviz": "3.0.0-dev-master.a0d076d"
  }
}
```

If you later want to again update to the bleeding edge, you will have to run the above command again.

## Configuration


## Compatibility

 `react-controls` is compatible with React v16+ and works with ReactDOM. React Native is not supported at this time.
